AI: increasing the representation power + batch normalization with understanding data

# Jan 26

mnist ( A ~ J ) training data pre-processing , 5-layer fc, 2-layer convolutional model has been tested with dropout...       2-layer conv test accuracy is around 95.7% ...  increasing the representational power of conv-layer would help get more accuracy. tomorrow's job.


# Jan 25

refactored all data pre-processing code
adding 2-layer perceptron, convolutional layer

(long hault .... busy for handling other stuff, now the concentration time again)

# Dec-21

assignment-1 copied, understood.... but not familiar yet... especially for hash function with duplicate removal

# Sep-20

cont'd


# Sep-19

assignment-1 started again.. sporadic work ruins the whole, beware!
